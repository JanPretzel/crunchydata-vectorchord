# CrunchyData PGO with VectorChord extension

This repository contains container images for [CrunchyData PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) that include the [VectorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord) extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the images also provide the [pgvecto.rs](https://github.com/tensorchord/pgvecto.rs) extension to allow migrations from pgvecto.rs to VectorChord. Future images will only provide the VectorChord extension.
